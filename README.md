Code demonstrating results in https://github.com/Kozea/WeasyPrint/issues/1995

After cloning the repo, run `./makepdf` to convert `documentation/langtagbug.html` to `./langtagbug.pdf`

Then compare display of `documentation/langtagbug.html` and `./pdf`, noting difference in the language-specific Wolof and Kyrgyz rendering.
